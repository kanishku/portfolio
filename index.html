                <h4>Elon Musk</h4>

                <p>Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American entrepreneur who
                    cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and
                    spacecraft.
                    He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, the
                    electric car manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk acquired Twitter (later X) in 2022.

                    Early life
                    Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for
                    computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer
                    magazine. In
                    1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to
                    support
                    apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic
                    opportunities
                    available in the United States.

                    PayPal and SpaceX
                    Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University
                    of
                    Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997.
                    He
                    enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only
                    two
                    days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in
                    physics.
                    In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers.
                    In
                    1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an
                    online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in
                    transferring
                    money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
                <p>Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the
                    major funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by
                    entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the
                    Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric
                    vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from 0
                    to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public
                    offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was
                    acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design.</p>
                <p>Musk joined the social media service Twitter in 2009, and, as @elonmusk, he became one of the most
                    popular accounts on the site, with more than 85 million followers as of 2022. He expressed
                    reservations about Tesla’s being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets
                    about taking the company private at a value of $420 per share, noting that he had “secured funding.”
                    (The value of $420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20, a day celebrated by devotees of
                    cannabis.) The following month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for
                    securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s
                    board rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign.
                    However, the news sent Tesla stock plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms
                    included Musk’s stepping down as chairman for three years, though he was allowed to continue as CEO;
                    his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers, and fines of $20 million for both Tesla and Musk
                    were levied.</p>
